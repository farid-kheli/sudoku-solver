A powerful Sudoku solver built with Selenium. This tool automates the process of solving Sudoku puzzles directly on a webpage. It extracts the grid from the webpage, solves it using an efficient backtracking algorithm, and inputs the solution back into the webpage.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated Grid Extraction**: Reads the Sudoku grid directly from the webpage.
- **Efficient Solving Algorithm**: Utilizes a backtracking algorithm to solve puzzles quickly.
- **Seamless Web Interaction**: Automatically fills the solved grid back into the webpage.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- ChromeDriver

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sudoku-solver.git

    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:  
    ```bash
    pip install selenium
    ```

3. **Set up ChromeDriver**:  
   - Download ChromeDriver from [Google Chrome Labs](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/).  
   - Place the `chromedriver` executable in the project directory. Ensure it is in the same location as your Python script.

## üìñ Usage

1. Open the script and confirm that the `executable_path` in the `Service` object points to your `chromedriver` file.

2. Run the script:  
    ```bash
    python sudoku.py
    ```

3. Watch as the script:
   - Launches a browser.
   - Navigates to the Sudoku puzzle webpage.
   - Extracts, solves, and fills in the solution.
